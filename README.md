# Minesweeper
This project is a self-taught (plus google) attempt at creating minecraft. I have a lot of experience playing the game (expert mode win % = ~2%), so I know how it should behave.
This is a useful project to better understand GUI development in Java, specifically JavaFX. I do not intend to infringe or claim any ownership of minesweeper as a game, this is
purely a personal attempt at cloning the game to test my coding abilities.
